<h2>Security, Logging and Maintenance</h2>

Security is one of the most important aspect of Information Technology. </br> 
I will go through common mistakes, brief overview of OWASP's Resources </br>
and we will look for stack specific vulnerabilities. </br> 
For Monitoring and Logging I like to Nagios Core system, because it is pretty straitforward and easy to use.</br>
Laslty we will look how to maintain this project and what to look out for.
